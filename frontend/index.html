            Ryan has been head-over-heels in love with computers and software since he was 10 years old. He started
            using tools like Blender and Game Maker to kickstart his interest in software engineering. Writing many
            (maybe not so good) games with game maker, he began to understand the basics of game design and code design.
            As he grew older, his interests only expanded from there into every technology he could get his hands on.
            Ryan is a Software Engineer working in Silicon Valley at a Machine Learning startup called Dilili Labs. He
            is the Product Manager and Lead Engineer for a modular synthetic data platform.<br><br> He taught
            programming classes at a company names WhizKidz for a number of years passing down his love for beautiful
            code.<br><br>
